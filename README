# Malare

Malare is a Malware Database to help you organize samples received and analyzed. 
It will store information like filename, md5sum, source from where the file got downloaded,
Domain name of the C&C, IP address and other notes in a SQLite database. One can list the 
whole database or search for samples based on filename, C&C or md5sum.

Malare saves all binary-samples added to database in its own folder.
